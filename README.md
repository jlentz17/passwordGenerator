# Password Generator

In the third week of bootcamp, I was given the assignment of making a random password generator with JavaScript. The project came with the front end already built with html and css. Here's a screenshot of it:

# Description 

I created an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they've selected. I then dynamically updated the html and css using Javascript.

When the button is clicked to generate a password, an alert comes up and asks the user which password length they desire. It must be between 8 and 128 characters. If not, set alert to pick right length. Then confirm if employee wants lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters using seperate definitions of variables and conditional statements. It should be validated that the employee chooses at least one character type. When all of the prompts are answered, then the password is generated and displays within the page.
